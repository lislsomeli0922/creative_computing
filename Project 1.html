	<p>They mistook my kindness for weakness.
		<br>
		I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
		can't a girl just do the best she can?

		<br>
		<br>
		Catch a wave and take in the sweetness.
		Think about it, the darkness, the deepness,
		All the things that make me who I am.
		<br>
		<br>
		And who I am is a big-time believer
		that people can change, but you don't have to leave her.
		<br>When everyone's talking, you can make a stand
		'cause even in the dark 
		<br>I feel your resistance.
		You can see my heart burning in the distance.
		<br>
		<br>
		Baby, baby, baby, I'm your <i>man.</i>
		<br>

		<br>
		<p>
		You lose your way, just take my hand.<br>
		You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again.
		<br>
		Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am.
		<br>
		<br>
		I'm your <i>man.</i>
		<br>
		I'm your <i>man.</i>
		<br>
		<br>
		Catch a wave and take in the sweetness.
		Take in the sweetness.
		You <u>want</u> this, you <u>need</u> this.
		Are you ready for it?
